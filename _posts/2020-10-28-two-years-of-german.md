When I only started learning German I was curious about what
I could expect from the language, how fast I would learn, and
what experience I would have. At that time, most of the stories
I could find on the Internet were about people reaching fluency
in half a year and guides about repeating their success.
I would gladly read something close to how I progress.
Learning English was tough. I didn't expect German
to be anytime easier. Now, after two years, I want to share
my experience. I will try to explain my motivation, how
I learn, what resources I use, how it went, how much
it cost, and where I am right now. First of all, I do it for myself,
but I hope other learners might find it useful.

**My motivation**. I work as a software engineer, and I looked for a hobby
that I would enjoy as much as programming. It had to be from
a completely different area. Learning a language sounded like a
good option. I was working for a German company at that time, and I was a frequent
guest in Munich. German seemed a natural choice. I found a couple
of German bands and tried listening to their music just to understand
how the language felt to me. The idea was simple: if you cannot enjoy
music in your target language, how do you plan to enjoy the language itself?
It is a kind of test for a language.
After a week of listening to German music, figuring out the texts,
I was convinced that it was what I was looking for.

**Music**. Starting from that point I keep listening to music in German.
I guess it makes 90% of all the music I listen to, and I do
not regret it. It is quite different from music in other languages.
Often songs would cover social issues I didn't know about their
existence. For instance, there is a whole cluster of songs about
life in East Germany before the unification. 
[This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIE8uHNUeRA)
is absolutely great.
It made me learn more about the subject. Another difference that
I find interesting is that songs might often be "unpredictable".
You listen to a song, you don't know the language, so you cannot understand the song,
but you like it. Then you look for the lyrics, and you’ll often be surprised
that they sing about something completely different than you thought. 
It happens all the time,
and it is great. If you don't know what I mean, try 
[this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkv64uLyEN0) or
[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xREl_68O-mw). I would say music is one
of my motivators to keep learning.

**Working with a teacher**. I am not a person who can learn a language by myself that's why
I found a teacher. We would work 2 hours a week, I would spend
an hour preparing for every lesson we had. I wish I could work
regularly with my teacher. The reality is that I often have to cancel a
lesson, or I have to postpone our lessons for a long period. Once it 
was for 3 months and at the moment of writing this text I haven't seen her
for two months. Nevertheless, we managed to complete A1 and A2
within the last two years. First, we worked with a book called
[Delfin Lehrwerk für Deutsch als Fremdsprache](https://shop.hueber.de/en/sprache-unterrichten/deutsch-als-fremdsprache-daf-daz/lehrwerk/delfin-3bdg-ausg-teil-1.html).
For A2, we decided to go with a different book - 
[Schritte International NEU](https://shop.hueber.de/en/schritte-int-neu-4-kb-ab-cd-z-ab.html) -
which was newer (people won't hang paper maps and iPhones were a thing).
The new book had two parts for A 2.1 and A 2.2. It turned out half of
the materials of A1.1 was already covered by my previous book,
the other half was new, but I used the new constructions
here and there, so we decided to jump to A2.2.
                                                    
Here are some of my materials:

I must say that working on home assignments sometimes
isn't that interesting, and from time to time I would "sabotage"
completing the exercises. On the flip side of the coin,
it is probably the most valuable part of the process.

**Communications**. The other important part was communications with native speakers.
I found people who were interested in language exchange
on Reddit and [conversationexchange.com](https://conversationexchange.com).
I did it after I had been learning German for two months.
With my level, I could say who I was and what the weather was like in my place.
However, there was a guy, who was ready to help. We used Skype for video calls. 
First months we would speak 10 minutes in German
and then an hour in Russian because 10 minutes is the
longest I could talk in German. I understood that
it was better to be prepared otherwise I would end
up talking about things we already discussed several times.
Talking to a native speaker even in the early stages helps a lot.
It helps understand what parts of the language are the most important
in order to keep the simplest communication. For instance,
straight away I needed past tenses (how else would you explain
how your day was?). However, they are taught only
at the end of A1. Having used past tenses with my friends,
I only summarized them by the book when we were learning
this part.

A half a year later, I met another guy from Germany who
lived in Kyiv and was learning Russian and Ukrainian. We would meet in person
and take long walks in the city centre discussing different
topics from computer science to life in different countries. Sometimes
he would talk to me in German and I would reply in Russian. This way we would be able to understand
each other a bit better. He returned to Germany, but we still keep in touch.

I practice I meet my German friends online 3-5 times a month.
It helps a lot in practicing the material I learn with my teacher.
It also brings joy. Being able to talk to my friends in their
language is the biggest reward for me.

**Media**. Another activity that I try to follow is watching TV shows in
German. It is fairly simple. I just switched to watching German
TV shows on Netflix. I don't know how much it helps. Probably
not that much considering my level. However, it makes me feel more confident
when I understand phrases before I read the subtitles (in Russian).
I must admit it is quite tough. It would probably take me a few years
till I'll be able to understand them without subtitles. As I said,
I do it for the joy that's why I don't care that it is inefficient.

Podcasts and Radio are also a part of my daily routine.
Unlike TV shows, it is way easier to understand them.
I like podcasts from Die Zeit magazine. They have many and
all are great. Of course, I miss a lot, but I
am happy when I get the ideas and follow the conversations.
With the radio, it is even simpler. I listen to news stations, mainly
B5 Aktuell. They mention many names which help get the context better.
They also repeat the same news several times a day adding more details. Sometimes
I would not understand the news the first time I listen, but the next time
I suddenly understand almost everything.
Radio and podcasts become a way of consuming information rather than learning.
I am really happy it is happening.

I am also subscribed to several German-speaking Twitter accounts. People
often use informal language or dialects there, it is always interesting to read
such tweets and try to find out what all those words could mean. Once I came
across a twitter-thread which was hard to comprehend, the shortcuts were unusual, but
it was somewhat readable. Then I learned that it was in the Luxembourgish language.

**Books**. I try reading simple books. It is quite hard. Although
bilingual books (books where every page is written in two languages)
help make it much easier. 
I have a book of fairy tales by Wilhelm Hauff.
It is supposed to be easy-reading because the texts are
written for children. It is more complicated than that. First, there is a
huge amount of words you'd never use in real life because the texts are from
1800ths. Second, the author used long complex
sentences. Taking into account the German grammar, I would often sit and
try to figure out which part of a sentence relates to what. A translation
would always help.

%}

Despite the complexities, the fairy tales
were great. I couldn't read them fast, and I always had the feeling
I couldn't wait to finish reading a tale. I also learned new concepts
from this book: structure of complex sentences, the past simple tense
(which is rarely used in verbal communications), names of animals, 
indirect speech (constructions with "sei").

**Applications**. Within these two years, I tried a dozen different
applications for learning languages, but I use actively only three
of them. The first one is a dictionary app called dict.cc. I like
it because it provides different options for translations as well
as the most common usages of a given word. The other app is called
Reverso Context. It allows you to search for usages of phrases or
language constructs in real texts. Say, if I am not sure how to say
something I would search if somebody else uses such a construction.
And the last one - Verben. It is a database of verb forms.
I also tried Anki cards, Duolingo, and some
other apps that many find useful. In my case though, they were not.
Anki is really helpful, but I couldn't force myself to use the app.
Duolingo was simply boring. 

Because I am a software engineer, I also created 
[a small application](https://github.com/shpota/zeit)
that helps to learn to tell the time in German. It is a Fitbit clock face
that would show time in text format so that a person could learn it.
I was creating it for myself in the first place, but I learned the
subject before I completed creating the application. It is funny that
there was a mistake and people would leave low ratings for the app, but
none wrote why they left a bad rating, so I couldn't guess what
was wrong. Later I corrected the mistake, and I started receiving
positive feedback.

**Traveling**. I thought if I visited German-speaking countries I would
be able to progress faster. It was a mistake. It certainly helps me stay motivated.
At the same time, I wasn't able to use German much except ordering food and
checking in to a hotel. Once we were in a popular Café in Vienna where we were offered to
share a table with tourists from Germany (it was a place with a line in front of the door).
I could talk to them in German but eventually,
their desire to practice English was stronger than my poor German, and we switched to English.

Surprisingly, I could use German in countries where people generally don't use German.
I'll tell you about this experience in audio in German. This way you can
hopefully take a grasp on what my level is.

I prepared this text and then recorded it. I did not correct my mistakes.
I did not use any resources either so that it could express my level better.

**Costs**. Altogether, I invested 35 425 UAH in learning. It is around 1100 EUR
by the current exchange rate. The sum includes money that I paid for
110 private lessons with my teacher and four books that I purchased.
Three of them I mentioned before, the other one is called "German in 30 days"
(I didn't work on it much though). I don't count the money I spent traveling
to Germany and Austria. If not in these countries, I would have spent my
vacations somewhere else.

**Summary**. After two years of learning German, I reached A2 (some say I
have B1, but I have never taken a test); I found new friends; I discovered
a whole new music universe; I am able to talk to people in German; I can
consume media in German, and most importantly, I had a lot of fun learning
the language. Most likely, I could have progressed faster, but I would
have to scarify my time by doing something I don't enjoy. 

If you managed to read to this point, I hope you found something interesting
for you. Please tell me what you think in the comments. If you have any questions
I would gladly answer them.

Learn a language, it is fun!
