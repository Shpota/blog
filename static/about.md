My name is Sasha Shpota. I am a programmer. I write
mostly in Java, but also in TypeScript and Python.
At the moment, I work as a full-stack developer. In
my day to day work, I implement back end functionality
with Java and Spring Boot, front end with Angular and
deliver the applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
I am a regular contributor to 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2065796/sasha-shpota?tab=profile).


I am a big fan of the DevOps culture and I believe
that a modern developer must manage the full application
cycle from designing the application to delivering it to
end-users. I also think that automation is the best way
to make programmersâ€™ lives easier.

In my spare time, I like reading books, going to the 
gym, traveling and enjoying free time with my family. 
Of course, I [code](https://github.com/Shpota) from
time to time. In the meantime I like exploring 
new cultures and new languages - I am learning
German at the moment and I can't wait until I am
able to communicate freely with native speakers.

On this blog, I share my thoughts about software
development.
